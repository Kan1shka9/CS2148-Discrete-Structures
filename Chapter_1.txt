🕶 Variable
Placeholder

Example 1
Use variables to rewrite the following sentences more formally.
a. Are there numbers with the property that the sum of their squares equals the square of their sum?
a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2
b. Given any real number, its square is nonnegative.
Given any real number r^2 is nonnegative

🕶 Kinds of Statements
1.) Universal statement
All positive numbers are greater than zero
"for all"
"every"
"all"

2.) Conditional statement 
If 378 is divisible by 18, then 378 is divisible by 6
"if-then"

3.) Existential statement
There is a prime number that is even
"there is"

4.) Universal Conditional Statements
Will have "for all" and "if-then"
For all animals a, if a is a dog, then a is a mammal.
For all real numbers x, if x is nonzero then x^2 is positive.
Universal conditional statements can be rewritten as purely universal or purely conditional
If a is a dog, then a is a mammal. -> Purely Conditional
For all dogs a, a is a mammal. -> Purely Universal

5.) Universal Existential Statements
Universal because First part says that a certain property is true for all objects of a given type and 
Existential because its Second part asserts the existence of something
Every real number has an additive inverse.
All real numbers have additive inverses.
For all real numbers r, there is an additive inverse for r.
For all real numbers r, there is a real number s such that s is an additive inverse for r.
When r is positive, s is negative, when r is negative, s is positive, and when r is zero, s is also zero.

6.) Existential Universal Statements
Existential because its First part asserts that a certain object exists
Universal because Second part says that object satisfies a certain property for all things of a certain kind
There is a positive integer that is less than or equal to every positive integer
There is a person in my class who is at least as old as every person in my class

🕶 Set
Collection of elements
C is the set of all countries that are currently in the United Nations, then the United States is an element of C
I is the set of all integers from 1 to 100, then the number 57 is an element of I
x ∈ S -> x is an element of S

1.) Set roster notation
{1,2,3}
{1, 2, 3, ..., 100} -> set of all integers from 1 to 100
{1, 2, 3, . . .} -> an infinite set

a. Let A = {1,2,3}, B = {3,1,2}, and C = {1,1,2,3,3,3}. 
What are the elements of A, B, and C? How are A, B, and C related?
A, B, and C have exactly the same three elements: 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, A, B, and C are simply different ways to represent the same set.

b. Is {0} = 0?
{0} not equal to 0 because {0} is a set with one element, namely 0, whereas 0 is just the symbol that represents the number zero

c. How many elements are in the set {1, {1}}?
Two elements: 1 and the set whose only element is 1.

d. For each nonnegative integer n, let Un = {n, −n}. Find U1, U2, and U0.
U1 = {1,−1}, U2 = {2,−2}, U0 = {0,−0} = {0,0} = {0}.

R -> set of all real numbers
Real Numbers (3 parts) -> +ve real numbers, -ve real numbers, 0
Z -> set of all integers (does not include 0)
Q -> set of all rational numbers, or quotients of integers
N -> set of all natural numbers
superscript + or − or the letters nonneg indicates that only the positive or negative or nonnegative elements of the set

Discrete Mathematics
The integers are all separated from each other, the set of integers is called discrete

Continuous Vs Discrete Mathematics

2.) Set-builder notation
The set of all elements x in S such that P(x) is true
{x ∈ S | P(x)}
{ -> set of all
| -> such that
{x | P(x)}
the set of all x such that P(x)

3.) Subsets
If A and B are sets, then A is called a subset of B, written A ⊆ B, if, and only if, every element of A is also an element of B.
Symbolically:
A ⊆ B means that For all elements x, if x ∈ A then x ∈ B.
For a set A not to be a subset of a set B means that there is at least one element of A that is not an element of B.
A ⊄ B means that For all elements x, if x ∈ A then x ∉ B.
All sets are subsets of themselves

4.) Proper Subset
Let A and B be sets. A is a proper subset of B if, and only if, every element of A is in B but there is at least one element of B that is not in A.

0 is not an integer (Z)

Distinction between ∈ and ⊆
∈ -> element of / belongs to
⊆ -> subset of
page 10 -> Example 1.2.4

5.) Cartesian Products (just a product)
Given sets A and B, the Cartesian product of A and B, denoted A × B and read “A cross B,” is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b), where a is in A and b is in B. Symbolically:
A × B = {(a, b) | a ∈ A and b ∈ B} 

A = {1,2,3} and B = {u,v}
A × B = {(1,u),(2,u),(3,u),(1,v),(2,v),(3,v)}
B × A = {(u,1),(u,2),(u,3),(v,1),(v,2),(v,3)}
B × B = {(u,u),(u,v),(v,u),(v,v)}
Total number of elements in A x B is {number of elements in A} times {number of elements in B}
Given sets A and B, the Cartesian product A × B is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where a is in A and b is in B

6.) Ordered Pairs
Given elements a and b, the symbol (a, b) denotes the ordered pair consisting of a and b together with the specification that a is the first element of the pair and b is the second element. Two ordered pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are equal if, and only if, a = c and b = d.
Symbolically:
(a,b) = (c,d) means that a=c and b=d
Is (1,2)=(2,1)?
No. By definition of equality of ordered pairs,
(1, 2) = (2, 1) if, and only if, 1 = 2 and 2 = 1.

Cartesian Plane -> Coordinate System

🕶 Relation
Let A and B be sets. A relation R from A to B is a subset of A × B. 
Given an ordered pair (x, y) in A×B, x is related to y by R, written x R y, if, and only if, (x, y) is in R. 
set A is called the domain of R
set B is called its co-domain
x R y means that (x,y) ∈ R.
1.) Relation as a subset
2.) Circle relation
3.) Arrow Diagrams of Relations

Function
Definition 1:-
A function F from a set A to a set B is a relation with domain A and co-domain B that satisfies the following two properties:
1. For every element x in A, there is an element y in B such that (x, y) ∈ F. 
2. For all elements x in A and y and z in B, if (x,y) ∈ F and (x,z) ∈ F, then y = z.

Definition 2:-
A relation F from A to B is a function if, and only if:
1. Every element of A is the first element of an ordered pair of F. 
2. No two distinct ordered pairs in F have the same first element.

Function Machines
Input -> x
Function Machine 
Output -> f(x)

Input(x) -> Function Machine -> Output(f(x))
Input -> Function Machine -> Output
x -> Function Machine -> f(x)

A relation is a subset of a Cartesian product and a function is a special kind of relation.
Specifically, if f and g are functions from a set A to a set B, then
f = { (x,y) ∈ A×B | y = f(x) } and g = { (x,y) ∈ A×B | y = g(x) }
