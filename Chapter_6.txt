Defining a set
A = {x ∈ S | P(x)}
S -> set
x belongs to S / x is an element of S
P(x) is a property that the elements of S may or may not satisfy

Subset
Proof
A ⊆ B ⇔ ∀x, if x ∈ A then x ∈ B
Disproof
A ⊄ B ⇔ ∃x such that x ∈ A and x ⊄ B
∃ -> there exists

Proper Subset
A is a proper subset of B if
(1) A ⊆ B
&
(2) there is at least one element in B that is not in A.

Fundamental proof technique of set theory is "element argument"

Element Argument:
The Basic Method for Proving That One Set Is a Subset of Another
Let sets X and Y be given.To prove that X ⊆ Y
1. suppose that x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen element of X
2. show that x is an element of Y.

Set Equality
Given sets A and B, A equals B, written A = B, if, and only if, every element of A is in B and every element of B is in A.
Symbolically:
A = B ⇔ A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A

Operations on Sets
A ∪ B = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}
Set of all elements that are in at least one of A or B
A ∩ B = {x ∈ U | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}
Set of all elements that are common to both A and B
B − A = { x ∈ U | x ∈ B and x ∉ A }
Set of all elements that are in B and not A
Ac = { x ∈ U | x ∉ A }
Set of all elements in U that are not in A

Given real numbers a and b with a ≤ b:
(a, b) = {x ∈ R | a < x < b}
(a, b] = {x ∈ R | a < x ≤ b}
[a, b] = {x ∈ R | a ≤ x ≤ b}
[a, b) = {x ∈ R | a ≤ x < b}
The symbols ∞ and −∞ are used to indicate intervals that are unbounded either on the right or on the left:
(a,∞) = {x ∈ R | x > a}
[a,∞) = {x ∈ R | x ≥ a}
(−∞,b) = {x ∈ R | x < b}
[−∞,b) = {x ∈ R | x ≤ b}

Partitions of Sets
Two sets are called disjoint if, and only if, they have no elements in common.
A and B are disjoint
A ∩ B = ∅

Given a set A, the power set of A, denoted P(A), is the set of all subsets of A

Properties Of Sets
1.) Intersection
(a) A ∩ B ⊆ A
(b) A ∩ B ⊆ B

2.) Union
(a) A ⊆ A ∪ B
(b) B ⊆ A ∪ B

3.) Transitive
if A ⊆ B and B ⊆ C, then A ⊆ C

Order of Precedence
A ∩ B ⊆ C means (A ∩ B) ⊆ C

Let X and Y be subsets of a universal set U and suppose x and y are elements of U .
1.) x ∈ X ∪ Y ⇔ x ∈ X or x ∈ Y
2.) x ∈ X ∩ Y ⇔ x ∈ X and x ∈ Y
3.) x ∈ X − Y ⇔ x ∈ X and x ∉ Y
4.) x ∈ X complement ⇔ x ∉ X
5.) (x,y) ∈ X × Y ⇔ x ∈ X and y ∈ Y
