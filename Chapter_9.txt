Sample space
Set of all possible outcomes of a random process or experiment

Event
Subset of a sample space

Probability
S -> Sample Space
E -> Event in S
P(E) = the number of outcomes in E / the total number of outcomes in S
P(E) = N(E) / N(S)

Example 9.1.1 Probabilities for a Deck of Cards
Black face card -> 6
Example 9.1.2 Rolling a Pair of Dice -> 36

Counting the Elements of a List
m and n are integers and m ≤ n
The Number of Elements in a List -> n - m + 1

Number of elements in 100 to 999
999 - 100 + 1
899 + 1
900 elements

Tree Structure
A tree structure is a useful tool for keeping systematic track of all possibilities in situa- tions in which events happen in order.

Permutations
A permutation of a set of objects is an ordering of the objects in a row
abc acb cba bac bca cab
n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 2·1 = n!
Example 9.2.8 Permutations of the Letters in a Word
Example 9.2.9 Permutations of Objects Around a Circle

Permutations of Selected Elements
P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!

Counting Elements of Disjoint Sets:

The Addition Rule
Example 9.3.1 Counting Passwords with Three or Fewer Letters
Example 9.3.2 Counting the Number of Integers Divisible by 5

The Difference Rule
Example 9.3.3 Counting PINs with Repeated Symbols
Example 9.3.4 Number of Python Identifiers of Eight or Fewer Characters
Example 9.3.5 Internet Addresses

The Inclusion/Exclusion Rule
N(A ∪ B) = N(A) + N(B) − N(A ∩ B)
N(A ∪ B ∪ C) = N(A) + N(B) + N(C) − N(A ∩ B) − N(A ∩ C) − N(B ∩ C) + N(A ∩ B ∩ C)

The Pigeonhole Principle
A function from one finite set to a smaller finite set cannot be one-to-one: There must be a least two elements in the domain that have the same image in the co-domain.
Example 9.4.1 Applying the Pigeonhole Principle
Example 9.4.2 Finding the Number to Pick to Ensure a Result
Example 9.4.3 Selecting a Pair of Integers with a Certain Sum

Application to Decimal Expansions of Fractions
When one integer is divided by another, it is the pigeonhole principle
Function from an infinite set to a finite set cannot be one-to-one
Example 9.4.4 The Decimal Expansion of a Fraction

Generalized Pigeonhole Principle
For any function f from a finite set X with n elements to a finite set Y with m elements and for any positive integer k, if k < n/m, then there is some y ∈ Y such that y is the image of at least k + 1 distinct elements of X .
